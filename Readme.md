# Codmetric â€“ Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot
 Description
A simple rule-based chatbot in Python that responds to greetings, farewells, and common questions using if/elif/else logic. Runs in the console (terminal).
1.  Rule Logic
- If user says **"hello"** or **"hi"** -> greeting response.
- If user asks **"how are you"** -> friendly response.
- If user asks **"your name"** -> bot introduces itself.
- If user says **"bye"** -> ends the conversation.
- For any other input -> "Sorry, I don't understand that."

2. Files
- `chatbot.py` â€” main script (run in terminal)
